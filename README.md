# IP Address Tracker

![Design preview for the IP Address Tracker](./design/desktop-preview.jpg)

## Welcome! üëã

This project created in React with SASS.For getting IP address location I used [IP Geolocation API by IPify](https://geo.ipify.org/) and for generating map [LeafletJS](https://leafletjs.com/). It's free to use and doesn't require an API Key.

‚ö†Ô∏è **IMPORTANT** ‚ö†Ô∏è: To use the this app, you'll need to sign up for a free account in IP Geolocation API by IPify. You won't need to add any cards details to do this and it's a very quick process. This will generate an API Key for you. Usually, you would be able to restrict your API Key to a specific URL (your own domain). This makes sure that other people can't use your API Key on their own websites. IPify doesn't have this feature, but because you aren't adding your card details, this isn't an issue. **So be sure to only sign up for the free account and DO NOT enter any card details**. Sign up here [IP Geolocation API by IPify](https://geo.ipify.org/),copy your API KEY and then go to components folder. In Container.jsx paste your key on state called "apiKey" and app ready to go :)
